## Description
This project allows a user to take and save notes with a title and text content. The initial screen contains a title and a button that will take the user to the notes page. The user can then create/save notes, view saved notes, and delete notes from that page. All saved notes can be accessed from any browser or computer and through any window closure or computer reset. This is accomplished by using server side code and npm packages to write all the notes to a .json file that is affiliated with the webpage's server.
